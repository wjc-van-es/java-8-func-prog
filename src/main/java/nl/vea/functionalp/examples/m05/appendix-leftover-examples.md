# Appendix A: sources for further study
There is a lot more still to learn about functional programming in general and in the context of Java as programming language. Underneath I have listed two books from which I took most examples.
See the literature list below.

## Books
- [RAOUL-GABRIEL URMA, MARIO FUSCO, AND ALAN MYCROFT, Modern Java in Action, LAMBDAS, STREAMS, FUNCTIONAL AND REACTIVE PROGRAMMING,
  ©2019 by Manning Publications Co](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action).
  - Most examples were taken from this book

- [Venkat Subramaniam, Functional Programming in Java, Harnessing the Power of Java 8 Lambda Expressions, 
Copyright © 2014 The Pragmatic Programmers, LLC](https://pragprog.com/titles/vsjava8/functional-programming-in-java/)
  - Another more advanced book about functional programming that will deepen your understanding.
  - Some examples in the later chapters are advanced and difficult.
