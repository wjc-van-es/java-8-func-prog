# Exercises
We intended to create a number of exercises around streams of Dish objects where we could do a lot of different filtering, grouping
collecting and reducing based on different inquiries. However, we ran out of time.

Still [StreamVsImperativeIteration](StreamVsImperativeIteration.java) is another good example of comparing the ease of functional 
programming versus imperative programming in the case of displaying a sorted list of all dishes with less than 400 calories in 
ascending order of calories.
